## üöÄ Overview

Documentation page is normally used to present detailed information on a specific topic or theme. The content includes definition, description and how to operate a technical device for example. Since I have a background in Environmental chemistry and technology, I would like to present an analysis approach by using **Inductive Coupled Plasma Mass** technology in analytical chemistry as a reference source for this exercise.

In this repository, the aim is to make a technical documentation page with coding languages, as **[HyperText Markup Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML#:~:text=The%20HyperText%20Markup%20Language%20or,(HyperText%20Markup%20Language)) and [Cascading Style Sheets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)** to provide detailed information to client.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Learning Objectives

After fulfilling the project, I acquire knowledge to:
* Build and style static webpages with semantic **HTML** and **CSS**
* Implement best practices and standards when structuring HTML files using nested elements, indentation, comments, and line breaks
* Implement the use of adding **Images & Links** into HTML, using **`<li>, <float>, so on`tags** to present the content of the project
* Implement CSS styling via class, id and element selectors using external stylesheets and inline styles
* Implement **Bootstrap** styling, **Google font**, **Font Awesome**, **CSS breakpoints** and **Navigation** with **Responsive web design** theory
* Use **Git workflow** to initialize projects, track changes, and host via remote server
* Execute live deployment using **GitHub** Pages

<div id='requirement'/> 

## üìã Requirements

**Build an app that is functionally similar to [this](https://technical-documentation-page.freecodecamp.rocks)**

**User Stories:** 
1. You can see a `main` element with a corresponding `id="main-doc"`, which contains the page's main content (technical documentation)
2. Within the `#main-doc` element, you can see several `section` elements, each with a class of `main-section`. There should be a minimum of five
3. The first element within each `.main-section` should be a `header` element, which contains text that describes the topic of that section.
4. Each `section` element with the class of `main-section` should also have an `id` that corresponds with the text of each `header` contained within it. Any spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The section that contains the header "JavaScript and Java" should have a corresponding `id="JavaScript_and_Java"`)
5. The `.main-section` elements should contain at least ten `p` elements total (not each)
6. The `.main-section` elements should contain at least five `code` elements total (not each)
7. The `.main-section` elements should contain at least five `li` items total (not each)
8. You can see a `nav` element with a corresponding `id="navbar"`
9. The navbar element should contain one `header` element which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation
10. Additionally, the navbar should contain link `(a)` elements with the class of `nav-link`. There should be one for every element with the class `main-section`
11. The `header` element in the `#navbar` must come before any link (a) elements in the navbar
12. Each element with the class of `nav-link` should contain text that corresponds to the `header` text within each `section` (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text "Hello world")
13. When you click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the `main-doc` element (e.g. If you click on a `nav-link` element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a `section` element with that id, and contains the corresponding header)
14. On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with `id="navbar"` should be shown on the left side of the screen and should always be visible to the user
15. Your technical documentation should use at least one media query
